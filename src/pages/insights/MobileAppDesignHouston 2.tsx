Nivk recommends focusing on clarity, accessibility, and local relevance to ensure your app resonates with Houston's diverse audience.</p>

            <li><strong>First impressions count:</strong> Users decide in seconds if your app feels trustworthy and easy to use.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-500">UX Mistakes to Avoid in Houston</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Ignoring accessibility:</strong> Houston's diverse population expects apps to be usable by everyone. Nivk recommends WCAG-compliant design.</li>
            <li><strong>Overcomplicating navigation:</strong> Simple, clear menus outperform complex flows.</li>
            <li><strong>Neglecting industry focus:</strong> Apps that don't consider Houston's major industries (energy, healthcare, aerospace) lose relevance fast.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="font-medium">Pro tip: Nivk's team always tests with local users to catch cultural and industry-specific issues before launch.</p>
