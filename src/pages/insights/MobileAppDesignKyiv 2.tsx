          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-500">UX Mistakes to Avoid in Kyiv</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Ignoring accessibility:</strong> Kyiv's diverse population expects apps to be usable by everyone. Nivk recommends WCAG-compliant design.</li>
            <li><strong>Overcomplicating navigation:</strong> Simple, clear menus outperform complex flows.</li>
            <li><strong>Neglecting localization:</strong> Apps that skip Ukrainian or local references lose users fast.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="font-medium">Pro tip: Nivk's team always tests with local users to catch cultural and language issues before launch.</p>
