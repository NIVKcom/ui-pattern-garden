        <section className="space-y-6">
          <p>Motivational speakers have the power to inspire change, but their impact is often limited to the moments they're on stage. Your app can be the bridge that keeps your message alive, your audience engaged, and your influence growing long after the applause fades. The speaking industry is evolving, and speakers who don't leverage technology risk being left behind.</p>
          <p className="font-medium">A custom motivational speaker app can be the difference between a speaker who inspires briefly and one who creates lasting transformation. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> The most successful motivational speaker apps prioritize content accessibility, community engagement, and features that help audiences implement the speaker's teachings in their daily lives.</p>
