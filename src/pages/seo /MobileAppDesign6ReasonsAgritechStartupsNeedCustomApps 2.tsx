          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-500">üåæ 6 Compelling Reasons Agritech Startups Need Custom Apps</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Precision Agriculture Integration:</strong> Custom apps can integrate with IoT sensors, drones, and satellite data to provide real-time insights on soil health, crop conditions, and weather patterns that generic solutions can't match.</li>
            <li><strong>Offline Functionality for Remote Areas:</strong> Agricultural operations often occur in areas with poor connectivity, requiring apps that work seamlessly offline and sync when connection is restored.</li>
            <li><strong>Complex Data Visualization:</strong> Farmers need intuitive ways to understand complex agricultural data, from yield predictions to pest management, that require custom visualization and reporting features.</li>
            <li><strong>Supply Chain Integration:</strong> Custom apps can connect farmers directly with processors, distributors, and retailers, creating transparent supply chains that increase profitability and reduce waste.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Agriculture faces strict regulations around food safety, environmental impact, and labor practices that require custom compliance tracking and reporting features.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Stakeholder Coordination:</strong> Agricultural operations involve multiple parties‚Äîfarmers, workers, suppliers, buyers‚Äîrequiring custom user management and communication systems.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>These reasons agritech startups need custom apps demonstrate why off-the-shelf solutions fall short in addressing the unique challenges of modern agriculture.</p>
